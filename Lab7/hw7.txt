4. Learning new emacs command by testing on a real text file
The Emacs command C-x 4 a adds a new entry to the change log file for the file you are editing (add-change-log-entry-other-window). If that file is actually a backup file, it makes an entry appropriate for the file's parentâ€”that is useful for making log entries for functions that have been deleted in the current version.

5. command used:
 emacs ~/quote-3.0-patch.txt
 C-x 4 a
 ChangeLog:
 This patch will effectively replace all the "`" in the pieces of code with "'" and  we only changes the character string constants .c files, not those in comments or documentations.
 C-x C-s to save
 C-x C-c to exit

6. command used:
   git add .
   git commit -F ~/ChangeLog
