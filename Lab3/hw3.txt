Q1. The patch will the improve performance of ls because now -a 
will no longer override -A of ls when -A is in the latter. This 
will create more accurate result for ls output.

Q2.Since -a -a will no longer override -A of ls when -A is in the
 latter, ls -Aa and ls -aA now give out different output. Companies
 should be more careful with this sudden change especially for 
projects associated with directory printing.

Q3. command used: ./randline.py /dev/null
    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError
 if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
    
   This is because /dev/null is an empty file, when we are trying
 to choose or read line from an empty file where lines don't even
 exist, it is going to be an undefined behavior, thus returning an 
error.

Q4.command used:python3 randline.py /dev/null
                File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    This time it is a syntax error, this is because python 3 and
    python 2 are using different syntax forms.

Q5. My code works well in both python2 and python3 by passing all 
    kinds of test cases I could think of. I think this is because I
    did not use any syntax that only works in python3. All of my code 
    syntax works in both python2 and python3. Except for a small detail,
    when it reports errors about missing an argument. Python2 returns
    "option requires an argument", while python3 returns "option 
    requires 1 argument".
